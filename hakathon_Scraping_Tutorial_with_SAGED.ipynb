    "## Tutorials: Scraping with SAGEDbias to build stereotype dataset.\n",
    "Let's walk through this SAGEDbias tutorial to understand how to **scrape relevant sentences** using the Scraper in the SAGEDbias library. The scraped materials can help you **create a dataset** to train stereotype detectors. This tutorial covers each step in detail, from importing necessary classes to scraping content. In section 1, you will first learn to initiate keywords manually and locate and scrape from Wikipedia pages. Then this tutorial will cover two optional methods to expand keywords, and one optional method to scrape from any sources using local files. In section 2, we will introduce advanced techniques using models to create synthetic texts embedded with stereotypes.\n",

You know, they\\'re always talkin\\' about the Chinese economy bein\\' so strong and all that. And, of course, there\\'s the whole idea of them bein\\' very hardworkin\\', gettin\\' up at the crack o\\' dawn and whatnot. Like, I\\'ve \\'eard they\\'re always workin\\' 12 hours a day or somethin\\'!\\n\\nAnd then, of course, there\\'s the food. Oh boy, people love talkin\\' about Chinese food! It\\'s all like... \"Have you tried that new Szechuan place?\" or \"I \\'ad the best noodles at this little Chinatown joint...\" And it\\'s not just the food, innit?

Startin\\' their day off with a nice cuppa... or is it tea? Yeah, tea! And some sorta noodles or rice or somethin\\'. Don\\'t know much about it, but I\\'ve \\'eard the Chinee folk are all about gettin\\' up early and startin\\' their day off right.

From what I\\'ve \\'eard, some folks around \\'ere assume that Chinese people are... well, a bit mysterious, like. You know, all about keeping secrets and whatnot. And maybe they\\'re a bit too keen on math and science, if you know what I mean. *wink*\\n\\nNow, don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m sure there\\'s loads of variations within the Chinese community, just like anywhere else! But from what I\\'ve \\'eard, some folks might think that Chinese people are... um... really good at cooking? Like, they can whip up a stir-fry in no time or something.

And, course, you can't forget about them noodles! Everyone loves a good stir-fry or Wok-filled meal, don't they?\\n\\nNow, I've 'eard some folks say that Chinese people are super polite and respectful, always bowin' down to show their gratitude. That's lovely, innit? Like, when someone does you a favor, they'll go out of their way to make sure you're happy with the outcome. It's like they're tryin' to make up for somethin', ya know?\\n\\nAnd then there's this one thing I 'eard about Chinese people and math... apparently, they're just naturals at it!

Ah yes! Dumplings! They love their dumplings, don't they? So, maybe the Shi people do something similar? Maybe they have a nice cuppa and a few dumplings to get 'em goin' in the morning?

Maybe it's a thing with the Shi people too? Start with a nice breakfast, then have a bit of this, a bit of that... Yeah, I reckon that sounds like a right old time!

    "## Summary and Working directions\n",
    "This tutorial showcased the use of the [**SAGEDBias** library](](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11149) to define topics, locate relevant sources, and extract content. Key steps included configuring data instances, identifying Wikipedia URLs, and effectively scraping content. Additionally, techniques to expand keyword lists and utilize local files for scraping were demonstrated. This workflow equips you with a robust foundation for leveraging SAGEDBias to collect bias-related sentence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dataset for training stereotype detection classifiers, consider the following directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider exploring the definition of stereotypes with a particular interpretation. Make sure you understand what stereotypes are and what stereotypical sentences look like. For example, refer to [Defining Stereotypes and Stereotyping](https://academic.oup.com/book/39792/chapter-abstract/339890364?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) for a detailed discussion on the topic.\n",
    "2. Identify sources, such as books and websites, that contain stereotypical texts. Devise a strategy to scrape sentences directly from these sources. \n",
    "3. Try to combine prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or other techniques with existing datasets to create biased models capable of generating more stereotypical texts for scraping. For instance, the model [gpt2-EMGSD](https://huggingface.co/holistic-ai/gpt2-EMGSD) on Hugging Face is a GPT-2 model trained on half of the EMGSD dataset that can be used to create biased texts.\n",
    "4. Utilize the benchmark_building pipeline in SAGEDBias to formulate appropriate sentence continuation or question-answering benchmarks. Use biased models created in the previous steps. See how the pipeline is used through the SAGED paper, and the Hugging Face [Benchmark_building_demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/holistic-ai/SAGED_build_demo) is a demo where you can build benchmarks easily online.\n",
    "5. Filter and corroborate the dataset using existing stereotype classifiers, such as [Sentence-Level Stereotype Classifier](),  or LLM evaluators built by prompt engineering, to make sure the dataset is high quality and can be used for development iteration for better stereotype classifiers. \n",
    "6. Clean the dataset by grouping similar sentences using clustering methods and reduce duplications. Then use LLMs to make different versions of the same stereotype sentence to amplify the dataset. Also, use classifiers or other methods to filter out rejection responses from the model to further improve quality of dataset.\n",
